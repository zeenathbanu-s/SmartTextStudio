🧠 Project Title

SmartText Studio – Team 3: Converting All Characters to Lowercase & Normalization

🎯 Project Description

This project demonstrates the process of text normalization in Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on:

Case Folding (convert text to lowercase)

Text Normalization (remove punctuation, extra spaces, emojis, etc.)

Accent Removal (convert “Héllò” → “hello”)

Lemmatization (convert “running”, “ran” → “run”)

It allows users to input any text in real time, process it through these stages, and visualize results via:

Word Clouds 🌀

Frequency Charts 📊

Before vs After comparison ✍️

Also performs Sentiment Analysis (Before vs After) using a pre-trained Hugging Face transformer model.

💬 Full Prompt (Paste This in Replit AI, Bolt, or V0.dev)

🔹 Prompt:

Build a web-based NLP app using Python (Streamlit) named SmartText Studio – Team 3: Text Normalization.

🎯 Goal: Allow users to enter any text in real time and perform the following tasks step by step:

Case Folding: Convert all characters to lowercase.

Text Normalization: Remove punctuation, emojis, numbers, and extra spaces.

Accent Removal: Normalize Unicode text (e.g., “Héllò” → “hello”).

Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form (run, running, ran → run).

📊 Visualization:

Generate Word Clouds for before vs after text.

Display Token Frequency Bar Charts for top N tokens.

Show Before vs After Text Comparison in two columns.

Perform Sentiment Analysis (Before vs After) using Hugging Face’s distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model, visualized as a comparison bar chart.

⚙️ Tech Stack:

Frontend/UI: Streamlit

Processing: spaCy + NLTK + Unidecode

Visualization: Matplotlib + WordCloud

Model: Transformers (Hugging Face sentiment pipeline)

Language: Python 3

🧠 UI Features:

Sidebar options to toggle word cloud / frequency chart / sentiment analysis.

A main text box for user input.

A button “Preprocess Text” to trigger processing.

Option to download cleaned text as .txt file.

📈 Expected Output Layout:

Title: “SmartText Studio – Team 3”

Input box for user text

Two columns showing “Original Text” vs “Cleaned Text”

Word Cloud visualization (side-by-side)

Token Frequency bar chart (before vs after)

Sentiment comparison chart

Include all necessary imports and requirements.txt.
The app should run directly when executing streamlit run app.py.

Make UI colorful and professional with Streamlit layout and markdown headings.
Add tooltips or notes for each process step for clarity.

Finally, show footer text:
“✨ Made with ❤️ by Team 3 – SmartText Studio (NLP Normalization Project)”

🎨 Example Output (in App)

Input Text:

“Héllooo!!! I AM Running So Fast 😍😂...”

Output (After Processing):

“hello i am run so fast”

Visuals:

Word Cloud (before → messy; after → clean)

Bar Chart (top token frequencies)

Sentiment: before = 0.93 (positive), after = 0.90 (positive)
